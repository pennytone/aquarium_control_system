# aquarium_control_system
This project is to create an environmental control and automation system for an home aquarium.
It will incorportate 
- Lighting control with simulated sunrise, sunsets along with moonphases
- warming and chilling of water temperatures
- automated feeding system
- water change automation
- water evaporation replenishment
- IP based system with MQTT triggers

I'll add more features as they come to mind. Feel free to add to the list.
